%Note: the structure and indices of model boxes to which we refer in this
%script are defined in the companion paper. Boxes are indexed from 1 to 8,
%from South to North and from top to bottom. Default model parameter 
%values proposed in this script enable to best reproduce observed (GloSSAC)
%Aerosol Optical Depth model boxes given observed SO2 injections by
%explosive volcanic eruptions (Carn et al. 2016 inventory).

%Vertical and latitudinal boundaries of model boxes
%==========================================================================
h1lim=16;%in km a.s.l., upper boundary of boxes 7-8
h2lim=20;%in km a.s.l., upper boundary of boxes 3-6
latlim=25;%in degree; tropical boxes latitudinal boundaries are +/- latlim

%Note: all model parameters have been calibrated with above box boundaries.
%If you wish to change these boundaries, we strongly recommend that you
%recalibrate model parameters and shape functions.

%We recommend to use the same production timescale in all boxes. However,
%production timescales can be set arbitrarly for each box. For example, for
%a production timescale of 8 months in middle stratospheric boxes (#1-3), 5
%months in the lower stratospheric boxes (# 4-6), and 2 months in lowermost
%stratospheric boxes (# 7-8), uncomment the line below:

%We recommend to use height-dependent and latitude-dependent (i.e., tropics
%vs. extratropics) loss timescales, as specified in the line above.
%However, loss timescales can be set arbitrarly for each box. For example,
%for a loss timescale of 3 month in all boxes, uncomment the line below:
%tauloss=[3;3;3;3;3;3;3;3];

%==========================================================================
%MIXING TIMESCALES
%==========================================================================
%Mixing timescales are defined by three parameters:
%1) The average value of mixing timescale taumixm
%2) The amplitude of the seasonal cycle of mixing amix
%3) The month of the year when mixing peaks smix (1=JAN, 12=DEC)
% The mixing timescale will then be calculated by the model at each
% timestep as:
% taumix=taumixm.*(1+amix.*cos((t-smix)*pi/6))
%with t the time in months after JAN XXXX
%Each of the 3 parameters taumixm, amix and smix has 6 values corresponding
%to box pairs 1-2, 2-3, 4-5, 5-6, 7-5 and 8-5


taumixm = [10.2*ones(4,1);inf;inf];

%We recommend to use the same mixing timescale for all box pairs, and to
%turn off non-horizontal mixing between box 5 (lower tropical stratosphere)
%and boxes 7-8 (lowermost tropical stratosphere), which corresponds to
%setting mixing timescales to infinity. Similarly to previous examples for
%sulfate and production timescales, you can arbitrarly set mixing
%timescales.

amix=zeros(6,1);
smix=zeros(6,1);

%Implementing a seasonal cycle for mixing does not significantly improve
%model performance, as defined in our paper. We thus do not set the
%amplitude of the seasonal cycle to 0. As an example, if you wish to use
%a seasonal cycle with a 20% seasonal variation in mixing timescale, with
%mixing in the southern hemisphere peaking in July mixing timescale, 
%with mixing in the southern hemisphere peaking in July and in the northern
%hemisphere peaking in January, uncomment the two lines below:

% amix=[0.2;0.2;0.2;0.2;0.2;0.2];
% smix=[7;1;7;1;7;1];

%ONE-WAY MIXING TIMESCALES
%==========================================================================
%These timescales are defined exactly in the same manner as
%mixing timescales above. They correspond to a flux of sulfate from
%tropical to extra-tropical boxes, with the flux being proportional to the
%mass of sulfate in the tropical box.


tauowmm=ones(6,1)*inf;
%We recommend to turn off one-way mixing (owm) in the model by setting the
%average value of one-way mixing timescales to infinity as above

aowm=zeros(6,1);% seasonal cycle amplitude for one-way mixing
sowm=zeros(6,1);% peak mixing month for one-way mixing

%passed to the function defining the model equations
